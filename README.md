### Wepack React Starter

This is my attempt of setting up webpack/react with HMR.

``` shell
> git clone
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

And then browse [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to start developing with react.

This config is strongly inspired by [survivejs](http://survivejs.com/).
